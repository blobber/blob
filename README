- Running Task

We're using hadoop as a java wrapper for both hadoop and non-hadoop tasks so for that reason you need to either have 
HADOOP_HOME variable being set to your hadoop home, or it will try a default location "/opt/hadoop". "Atom" of each
run is Task/Application and each Task/Application actually represents one java package with 2 basic classes i.e.:

public class KMeansTaskFactory implements TaskFactoryIF {
....
}

public class KMeansTask extends Task implements TaskIF {
....
}

Certain application/task can be started with:

./bin/blob -a [application/task name] -c [yaml config file]

- Configuration classes 

Config class extends the ConfigNode class and basically represents the tree structure of ConfigNodes which is being 
created from yaml structure of configuration file passed to this task, so in example:

  kmeans:
	  test1: aa
	  test2: bb
	
will be created to following class structure

  Config(root class)
	  |
	  |--ConfigNode(key => "kmeans", val => "")
	       |
	       |--ConfigNode(key => "test", val => "aa")
	       |
	       |--ConfigNode(key => "test2", val => "bb")
	
Config also supports iterating over it's elements, as well as very simplified xpath-like query language:

	config.get("kmeans/test").val => "aa"
	config.get("kmeans").val => ""
